# haskellbook

This repository contains notes and exercises for "Haskell Programming from first principles" by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki. This is mainly for my own personal reference, but others are free to use this repository as a resource for themselves.

Some sections/chapters may be incomplete. Spelling errors are likely to be rampant. Formatting is likely to vary wildly. I try.
